Awesome meticulous job so far. Please keep up the same rigorous and meticulous approach going forward. Please think deeper and think harder to meticulously explore thoroughly and systematically how best to create a detailed, comprehensive, informative and attractive `README.md` for the GitHub repo that hosts this project; include a section to describe the application architecture with a file hierarchy diagram listing key files with their description, a mermaid diagram to describe the user and application interaction, and a mermaid diagram to show the application logic flow, and a section on deployment. Try to make it an awesome, complete, and useful `README.md` for the project. Then meticulously create a plan to create the `README.md`. Using your deep understanding of the current project status and the state of the current codebase, review and validate the plan before proceeding cautiously to execute.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please meticulously plan and create the detailed comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` with file hierarchy diagram with listing of key files and their description, mermaid diagrams to show the application flowcharts and the database schema. Review and validate the PAD against the project planning documents and the actual codebase. Finally, create a detailed and comprehensive `Project_Architecture_Document.md` in the project root folder, as the single source-of-truth handbook to fully initialize new developer or another coding agent to be able to handle new PRs independently.

please meticulously review and orientate where you last stopped, then meticulously continue from where you last stopped according to your earlier plan.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work. Now, please meticulously review the codebase files to align your understanding of the current state of the project and the actual implemention. Then meticulously create a briefing document for an AI coding agent to be able to continue from the present state. After conducting your meticulous codebase review to align your understanding of the codebase, you will create a comprehensive *single-source-of-truth* briefing document for any coding agent or human developer to have the same deep understanding of the project and the current codebase status. Save the agent *briefing document* that captures your aligned and validated understanding as a markdown file `CLAUDE.md`.
