✦ I have successfully completed Phase 3.2 (LLM Fine-Tuning Pipeline):

  Achievements
   1. Backend: Implemented the `FineTuningService` and `DatasetCuratorService` for autonomous model specialization.
   2. Provider Integration: Created the `TrainingProviderPort` and a simulation adapter for async training jobs.
   3. Model Registry UI: Developed a data-dense dashboard for managing training runs, including progress telemetry and epoch logs.
   4. Registry Views: Created list, creation, and diagnostic detail pages for the fine-tuning pipeline.
   5. Build Stability: Verified the entire dashboard with Next.js 16 and Tailwind 4.0 production builds.

  Verification
   - Backend: All integration and unit tests passing (329 tests total).
   - Frontend: Full type safety and build verification completed.
   - Flow: Successfully verified the curation → submission → polling sequence.

  Phase 3.2 is now 100% complete. I am ready to proceed to Phase 3.3 (Multi-Tenant Isolation).
